# vr

A collection of small WebXR prototypes for the Meta Quest 2 browser, built with [A-Frame](https://aframe.io) via CDN — no build step, no npm install. Each prototype is a single, self-contained HTML file.

Deployed as a static site (planned: `vr.noahwright.dev` via Netlify).

## Structure

```
/index.html              landing page linking to every prototype
/games/<name>/index.html one folder per prototype, fully self-contained
```

To add a new prototype: create `games/<name>/index.html`, and add a link to it from the root `index.html`. Nothing else needs to change — each game manages its own A-Frame version, components, and assets.

## Prototypes

- **[Cube Pop](games/cube-pop/index.html)** — point a Quest controller at a floating cube and pull the trigger to pop it. Counter tracks progress; popping all cubes shows a win state with an in-VR reset button. Also has a gaze-reticle fallback so you can validate it from a phone or desktop browser without a headset — see below.

## Running locally

Any static file server works. From the repo root:

```
python3 -m http.server 8080
```

Then open `http://localhost:8080` in a desktop browser to sanity-check the page.

## Testing without a headset (phone or desktop)

Cube Pop has a small reticle (ring) fixed to the center of the camera view, in addition to the VR controller lasers. It works with no headset at all:

- **Phone**: open the deployed Netlify/GitHub Pages URL in your phone's browser. Look around by tilting the phone (it uses the gyroscope); when the reticle sits on a cube, tap anywhere on the screen to pop it.
- **Desktop**: click-and-drag on the page to look around, then click a cube to pop it.

This is meant for quick sanity checks (did my change break spawning/popping/win/reset?) — it's not a replacement for testing the real controller-trigger interaction on the Quest 2 itself.

## Testing on a Quest 2

WebXR only activates in a "secure context" — `https://` origins, or `http://localhost`. A page served from your computer's plain LAN IP (e.g. `http://192.168.1.23:8080`) will **not** show the "Enter VR" button on the headset, even though the 3D scene loads fine. Pick one of these to get a real secure-context URL onto the Quest:

**Option A — USB + adb reverse (no internet needed, fastest for iteration)**
1. Enable Developer Mode on the Quest (via the Meta Quest phone app) and plug it into your computer via USB.
2. Confirm the headset is visible: `adb devices` (install `adb` / Android platform-tools if you don't have it).
3. Forward the port: `adb reverse tcp:8080 tcp:8080`
4. On the Quest, open the browser and go to `http://localhost:8080` — `localhost` counts as secure, so WebXR works over the forwarded USB connection.
5. Put on the headset, navigate to `games/cube-pop/`, and you should see an "Enter VR" button.

**Option B — tunnel (works over Wi-Fi, no USB/adb setup)**
1. Run your local server as above.
2. Run a tunnel, e.g. `ngrok http 8080`.
3. Open the `https://...ngrok...` URL it gives you directly in the Quest Browser.

**Option C — push to a real https host**
Once this repo is on Netlify (or GitHub Pages in the meantime), just open the deployed `https://` URL in the Quest Browser — no local networking tricks needed. This is the simplest option once the site is live, and the same URL works for every prototype in the collection going forward.

### In the headset

1. Open the URL for a prototype (e.g. `.../games/cube-pop/`).
2. Tap the "Enter VR" button that A-Frame renders automatically.
3. Point either controller at a cube; a laser line shows what you're aiming at.
4. Pull the trigger to pop it. Pop all of them to trigger the win state, then point at the green "RESET" box and pull the trigger again to play another round.
